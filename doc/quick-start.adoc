= Quick Start to Building an NOT logic gate

The objective of this Quick Start is to demonstrate how to create a Capnproto Schema called an `edge`, Rust `agent` and a `subgraph` hierarchy in Fractalide. Each Fractalide feature can be easily demonstrated by building a NAND logic gate then composing that into a contrived NOT logic gate. We shan't go into details about each `edge` `agent` and `subgraph` instead the emphasis is how these pieces interact with each other. Please reference the specialized documentation in each of the relevant directories for more information.

Note the `NOT` and `NAND` logic gates are purely for example purposes and would never be used in a production system.

* git clone the Fractalide source code:

[source, sh]
----
$ git clone git://github.com/fractalide/fractalide.git
$ cd fractalide
----

* Find a good place to in the Fractalide `edges` directory to add your capnproto `schema`. For instance a simple boolean schema for a Nand logic gate might go into `edges/prim/bool`. Where `prim` is short for `primative`.

The directory will have one file:

[source, nix, subs="none"]
.edges/prim/bool/default.nix
----
{ edge, edges }:

edge {
  src = ./.;
  edges =  with edges; [];
  schema = with edges; &#x27;&#x27;
    struct PrimBool {
            bool @0 :Bool;
    }
  &#x27;&#x27;;
}
----

* Now we need to make your new `edge` seen by the system. Insert your newly created `edge` into `edges/default.nix`.

[source, nix, subs="none"]
.edges/default.nix
----
  { pkgs, support, ... }:
let
callPackage = pkgs.lib.callPackageWith (pkgs // support);
in
# insert in alphabetical order to reduce conflicts
rec {
  # raw
  ...
  PrimText = callPackage ./generic/text {};
  PrimBool = callPackage ./edges/prim/bool {};
  ...
}
----

* Do a test compilation of your `edge` with this command:

[source, sh]
----
$ nix-build -A edges.PrimBool
----

If you see something like the below, then it successfully compiled the `edge` and it's ready to be used by `agents`.

[source, sh]
----
/nix/store/jy9yjnnmlpc7bzaq5ihjqwiywrx59fw4-PrimBool
----

The `edges/default.nix` file contains all the `edges` which abstract out capnproto `schema` for this Fractal: https://github.com/fractalide/fractalide/blob/master/edges/default.nix[edges/default.nix]

* Ensure your soon to be created NAND `agent` will have the right `crate` dependencies by navigating to the `modules/rs/crates/Cargo.toml` file and adding the relevant `crates` as needed:

[source, toml]
.modules/rs/crates/Cargo.toml
----
[lib]

[package]
name = "all_crates"
version = "0.0.0"

[dependencies]
rustfbp = { path = "../rustfbp" }
capnp = "*"
capnpc = "*"
nom = "*"
...
----

You will only need `rustfbp` and `capnp` for this `NAND` example. Those dependencies are already in the file, but we'll pretend they aren't. The `[lib]` and `all_crates` in the `[package]` section are just placeholders and is only there to appease the `cargo generate-lockfile` command. The `all_crates` `[package]` should never be used.

Next you run `./update.sh`. You should see similar output as the below:

[source, sh]

There's a bug in cargo2nix please manually check that all build_dependencies don't resolve to an undefined nix closure.
For example if you search for winapi_build_0_0_0, this should be changed to winapi_build_0_1_1_
Please make a pull request to resolve this issue in cargo2nix.
----

As noted in the output there is a minor bug with `cargo2nix`. Please manually ensure `build_dependencies` don't resolve to incorrect nix expressions in the generated `modules/rs/cates/default.nix` file. The typical case is `winapi_0_0_0` should be `winapi_0_1_1_` (or whatever the latest `winapi` version is). A safe way is to search for `0_0_0` and correct these instances as needed.

* The next step is to build our Rust NAND gate `agent`.

Find a good place to create our NAND gate is `nodes/rs/maths/boolean/nand/lib.rs`:

[source, sh]
----
$ mkdir -p nodes/rs/maths/boolean/nand
$ touch nodes/rs/maths/boolean/nand/lib.rs
----

The contents of the `lib.rs` should be this:

[source, rust]
.nodes/rs/maths/boolean/nand/lib.rs
----
#[macro_use]
extern crate rustfbp;


agent! {
  input(a: prim_bool, b: prim_bool),
  output(output: prim_bool),
  fn run(&mut self) -> Result<Signal> {
    let a = {
        let mut msg_a = try!(self.input.a.recv());
        let boolean: prim_bool::Reader = msg_a.read_schema()?;
        boolean.get_bool()
    };
    let b = {
        let mut msg_b = try!(self.input.b.recv());
        let boolean: prim_bool::Reader = msg_b.read_schema()?;
        boolean.get_bool()
    };

    let mut out_msg = Msg::new();
    {
      let mut boolean = out_msg.build_schema::<prim_bool::Builder>();
      boolean.set_bool(if a == true && b == true {false} else {true});
    }
    try!(self.output.output.send(out_msg));
    Ok(End)
  }
}
----

Notice the `prim_bool` code, these are referencing the `prim/bool/default.nix` `edge` we created earlier.

Notice the lines below:
```
extern crate rustfbp;

```
This code includes our `rustfbp` and `capnp` crates into the Rust `agent` code.

We've still not tied the `edges` nor `crates` dependencies into the `NAND` implemenation yet. This is done next.

* You will need to add a `default.nix` to your new `NAND` component.

[source, sh]
----
$ touch nodes/rs/maths/boolean/nand/default.nix
----

Then insert the below into the `default.nix`

[source, nix, subs="none"]
.nodes/rs/maths/boolean/nand/default.nix
----
{ agent, edges, mods, pkgs }:

agent {
  src = ./.;
  edges = with edges; [ PrimBool ];
  mods = with mods.rs; [ rustfbp capnp ];
  osdeps = with pkgs; [];
}

----

Notice `edges = with edges; [ PrimBool ];` is where we will compile the Capnproto `schema` which gets copied it into the `/tmp/nix-build-prim_bool-*-drv/` directory at build time (all automated by `nix`, don't worry about it). This is how your Rust compilation will see the compiled capnproto `schema`.

Also `mods = with mods.rs; [ rustfbp capnp ];` is where we included our `crate` dependencies as specified in the `modules/rs/crates/Cargo.toml` file.

* We need to make our `NAND` seen by the system by adding it to `nodes/rs/default.nix`

[source, nix, subs="none"]
.nodes/rs/default.nix
----
{ pkgs, support, ... }:
let
  callPackage = pkgs.lib.callPackageWith (pkgs // support // self);
  # insert in alphabetical order to reduce conflicts
  self = rec {
    ...
    maths_boolean_nand = callPackage ./maths/boolean/nand {};
    ...
    };
in
  self
----

* Now that the NAND logic gate is tied into Fractalide we can compile it:

[source, sh]
----
$ cd path/to/fractalide
$ nix-build -A components.rs.maths_boolean_nand
----

Congratulations, you've created and compiled your first `edge` and Rust `agent`. Now we will move on to creating a `subgraph` and our final step, the NOT gate.

* Create the `NOT` `subgraph`:

[source, sh]
----
mkdir -p nodes/rs/maths/boolean/not
touch nodes/rs/maths/boolean/not/default.nix
----

Then insert the below into `default.nix`:

[source, nix, subs="none"]
.nodes/rs/maths/boolean/not/default.nix
----
{ subgraph, nodes, edges }:

subgraph {
  src = ./.;
  flowscript = with nodes.rs; &#x27;&#x27;
    input => input clone(${msg_clone})
    clone() clone[1] -> a nand(${maths_boolean_nand}) output => output
    clone() clone[2] -> b nand()
  &#x27;&#x27;;
}

----

Notice the `${maths_boolean_nand}` and `${msg_clone}`. Nix will replace these with fully qualified paths to the compiled `agents` at compile time. `msg_clone` is a different `agent`, you may reference the source code at `nodes/rs/msg/clone`.


* Add your new NOT `subgraph` to the `nodes/rs/default.nix`

[source, nix, subs="none"]
.nodes/rs/default.nix
----
{ pkgs, support, ... }:
let
  callPackage = pkgs.lib.callPackageWith (pkgs // support // self);
  # insert in alphabetical order to reduce conflicts
  self = rec {
  ...
    maths_boolean_nand = callPackage ./maths/boolean/nand {};
    maths_boolean_not = callPackage ./maths/boolean/not {};
  ...
  };
in
  self
----

* Let's compile our newly created `NOT` `subgraph`:

[source, sh]
----
$ nix-build -A nodes.rs.maths_boolean_not
/nix/store/xdp2l67gdmxi7fagxnbanavcxd93mlr0-maths_boolean_not
----

The `subgraph` will compile to :

[source]
./nix/store/xdp2l67gdmxi7fagxnbanavcxd93mlr0-maths_boolean_not/lib/lib.subgraph
----
input => input clone(/nix/store/wb6fgpz9hk7fg1f6p9if81s1xhflhy2x-msg_clone)
clone() clone[1] -> a nand(/nix/store/bi0jacqxz1az1bbrc8470jbl7z3cmwdn-maths_boolean_nand) output => output
clone() clone[2] -> b nand()
----

Notice the `${maths_boolean_nand}` and `${msg_clone}` were replaced with fully qualified paths. This output is meant for the `fvm` (Fractalide Virtual Machine) to parse and isn't meant to be edited by humans.

* Let us prepare to run our new `NOT` component. This is where we create `imsgs` which contain the actual values to be passed into the `NOT` gate.

First, edit `nodes/rs/test/not/default.nix` so that it looks like this:

[source, nix, subs="none"]
.nodes/rs/test/not/default.nix
----
{ subgraph, imsg, nodes, edges }:

let
  PrimBool = imsg {
    class = edges.PrimBool;
    text = "(bool=true)";
    option = "create";
  };
in
subgraph {
 src = ./.;
 flowscript = with nodes.rs; &#x27;&#x27;
  '${PrimBool}' -> input not(${maths_boolean_not}) output -> input io_print(${maths_boolean_print})
 &#x27;&#x27;;
}
----

Notice the section of code:
```
PrimBool = imsg {
  class = edges.PrimBool;
  text = "(bool=true)";
  option = "create";
};
```
This declares an `imsg`, it defines the values to initialize your `edges/prim/bool` `edge`.

* Next, you'll need to compile `test_not`:

[source, sh]
----
$ nix-build --argstr node test_not
...
/nix/store/a4lb3b9jjylvrl77kv0wb8m5v137f6j1-test_not
----

* Then run it:

[source, sh]
----
$ ./result
boolean : false
----

* Conclusion

This concludes the Quick Start, demonstrating the building of a Capnproto `schema` which composes into an `edge`, a Rust `agent` and a Flowscript `subgraph`. It also demonstrates how to add crates.io `crate` dependencies and how to run the top level `not` `subgraph`.
